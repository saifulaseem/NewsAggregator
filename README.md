# NewsAggregator
News Aggregator using RSS feed (MicroDegree hackathon at KTEC Innovation Hub)

A very basic news aggregator that uses RSS Feed to display news from various news providers using their RSS Feeds. We have also implemented a map interface that allows the user to select news from specific reginos by selecting the region from the map.
Can be improved much further but we had little time to work on it.
